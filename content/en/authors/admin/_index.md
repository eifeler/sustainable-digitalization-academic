I have a passion for Sustainability, Digital Transformation and (Industrial) Internet of Things ((I)IoT) projects that deal with resource efficiency and optimization of production processes - transforming businesses on various levels.

The synergies of combining (I)IoT and business systems like MES and ERP to foster digital ecosystems play an important role in my projects.

My background is business informatics and after spending more than 20 years developing large-scale software systems and acting as software architect and Technical Manager in national and international projects I now focus on bridging the gap between the technical aspects of Digital Transformation and the not enough digitalized current state of Circular Economy and Sustainability.
 
I strive for innovative solutions to be deployed outside R&D departments and facing the "real world" in businesses.
